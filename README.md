There are 2 parts of this app:
1. One part detects face and make sticker from it
2. Other part detects face and when clicked on any sticker, it shows the sticker as mask over the face

This video streaming can be recorded and saved to photo library.

So, make face stickers of your friends and have fun by replacing others' faces with it. 


# Usage:
